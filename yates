Yates, 26, became the third different British rider to win a Grand Tour in the same year after Chris Froome in the Giro dâ€™Italia and Geraint Thomas in the Tour de France.

The rider from Bury in Lancashire finished safely in the main pack as Italian champion Viviani (Quick-Step Floors) beat the Slovakian world champion Peter Sagan (Bora-Hansgrohe) and compatriot Giacomo Nizzolo (Trek-Segadredo) in a fiercely fought sprint finish to Stage 21.
